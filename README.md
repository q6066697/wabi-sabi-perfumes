PROMPT:Build a mobile website for a perfume brand, distilled through a Wabi-Sabi lens. 

The hero opens full-screen: AI-rendered dawn light settling on stone, raw wood and brittle flowers, a single bottle half-disappeared into morning mist. 

Headline whispers: “Beauty in what vanishes.” Incense smoke drifts across the scene, fading with each breath-scroll. 

Below, three fragrances float as cards:  
- Silence — white tea, dry sandalwood; visual of steam curling over cracked porcelain. 
- Shadow — cool moss, rain-soaked air; image of dew on dark stone. 
- Stillness — warm slate, faint temple incense; picture of a weather-worn statue wrapped in bamboo shade. 
Every card carries a haiku-like note and a quiet “Shop Now” outline that fills on touch. 

The brand story unfolds vertically: cracked bowls, tea rituals, fallen ginkgo leaves, each panel edge blurred like ink washed by rain.
 A lifestyle mood board follows—minimal tatami corners, pottery fissures catching light—captioned: “Slow scent for slower time.”  


- Palette: off-white, muted grey, deep green, ochre. 
- Navigation hides behind a translucent stone icon; swipe, don’t click. 
- The entire site feels like stepping into a perfume atelier secretly tucked inside a Zen garden—quiet, poetic, forever on the verge of disappearing.
